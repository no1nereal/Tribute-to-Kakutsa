# tribute to kakutsa cholokashvili

a tribute page to the legendary kakutsa cholokashvili—georgia’s fearless freedom fighter. this project honors his courage and unyielding spirit, designed as my second step into web development.

## what’s inside:
- **timeline of his life**: key moments in kakutsa’s journey.
- **minimalist design**: inspired by his bold, iconic legacy.
- **historical imagery**: highlighting georgia’s rich culture.

## why i made this:
kakutsa is more than history—he’s a symbol of strength and resilience, values i hold close. this page is a blend of tribute and creativity, showing my progress in coding while honoring a legend.
